# dmenu script to jump to windows in i3.
# Makes a list of nicely formatted strings for each open window, containing
# workspace name, mark (if any), window title, and instance (would the previous
# give a non-unique result). dmenu provides a fast method of selection. 
# If the result of dmenu is that there is no match for an existing window, 
# the currently focused window will get a mark with this word. 
#
# using ziberna's i3-py library: https://github.com/ziberna/i3-py
# depends: dmenu (vertical patch), i3.
